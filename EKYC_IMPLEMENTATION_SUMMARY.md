# eKYC Verification Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) verification feature for Trabaholink, similar to GCash's verification process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Models (`users/models.py`)

#### CustomUser Model - New Fields Added:
- `is_verified` (Boolean) - Indicates if user is verified
- `verification_status` (CharField) - Status: unverified, pending, verified, rejected
- `verification_date` (DateTimeField) - When verification was approved
- `date_of_birth` (DateField) - User's date of birth

#### New Model: AccountVerification
Tracks all verification submissions with:
- Personal information (full_name, date_of_birth, address, contact_number, gender)
- ID information (id_type, id_image_front, id_image_back)
- Selfie verification (selfie_image)
- Review status (status, submitted_at, reviewed_at, reviewed_by, rejection_reason)

### 2. Forms (`users/forms.py`)

Created three step forms:
- `VerificationStep1Form` - Personal information
- `VerificationStep2Form` - ID upload
- `VerificationStep3Form` - Selfie capture

- `VerificationStep4View` - Review and submit
- `VerificationPendingView` - Pending status page
- `VerificationSuccessView` - Success confirmation
- `VerificationFailedView` - Rejection page

### 4. URLs (`users/urls.py`)

Added 8 new URL patterns:
- `/verification/start/` - ekyc_start
- `/verification/step1/` - ekyc_step1
- `/verification/step2/` - ekyc_step2
- `/verification/step3/` - ekyc_step3
- `/verification/step4/` - ekyc_step4
- `/verification/pending/` - ekyc_pending
- `/verification/success/` - ekyc_success
- `/verification/failed/` - ekyc_failed

### 5. Admin Interface (`users/admin.py`)

Enhanced admin panel with:
- `AccountVerificationAdmin` - Full verification review interface
- Image previews for ID and selfie
- Automatic user status updates on approval/rejection

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations users
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create Templates:**
   - Create all 8 template files listed above
   - Use Bootstrap styling to match existing design
   - Include progress indicators for steps 1-4

3. **Test the Flow:**
   - Register a new user
   - Navigate to profile
   - Click "Verify Account"
   - Complete all 4 steps
   - Check admin panel for verification review
   - Approve/reject and verify notifications

4. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Add email notifications
   - Integrate with 3rd-party ID verification APIs
   - Add face matching between ID and selfie
   - Implement document OCR for automatic data extraction

## Features Implemented

✅ Multi-step verification process
✅ Session-based form data storage
✅ File upload handling for ID and selfie
✅ Admin review interface with image previews
✅ Automatic user status updates
✅ Notification system integration
✅ Blue checkmark badge for verified users
✅ Status badges on profile

## Security Considerations

- All views require login (`LoginRequiredMixin`)
- Step validation ensures sequential completion
- Admin-only verification approval
- Secure file upload to separate directories
- Session data cleared after submission
