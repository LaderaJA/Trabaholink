# DISABLED: This file contained Playwright automation for verify.philsys.gov.ph
# which violates the portal's terms of use (robots.txt disallows all automation)
#
# The functionality has been replaced with offline verification using:
# - QR code extraction and parsing
# - OCR from ID images
# - Facial recognition matching
# - See users/verification_new.py for the new implementation
#
# Original file renamed to tasks_philsys_verify.py.disabled
